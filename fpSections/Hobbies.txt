Hobbies

Although I am really into making devices, I am also a sports enthusiast who enjoys football and basketball. I grew up playing basketball and eventually coached a youth recreation league team who made it to the championship. I typically play point guard, but I am probably best at shooting guard since the strongest part of my game is jump shooting.

I am a very detail oriented person, so I actually enjoy solving problems. Engineering is the perfect profession for me because I like to solve problems and ensure that every detail is covered. In general, I like to create things, both artistically and scientifically. It is a tough balance at times, but life is both logical and irrational.
